# Audio Player for DJ Mixes

With a bit of JavaScript, it's possible to make a great-looking audio player that updates track names, accompanying images and track progress. However, these players generally rely on multiple audio files to load new track data. I wanted an audio player made specifically for DJ mixes, which loads only one long, and largely opaque, audio file.

So I custom built a web audio player designed specifically for DJ mixes. A single audio file can be skipped around as normal, but the tracklisting syncs to the mix timings, rather than audio file data. As the mix plays the listener knows at a glance exactly which song the DJ is spinning!

Start by assembling your HTML/CSS, then use music_player.js to add functionality. Please note: some css has been taken from cloudflare.com.

I hope itâ€™s suitable for your DJ mixes!
